**Introduction**

Nepal is the poorest country in South Asia and ranks as the 17th poorest globally. Around 25 percent of Nepalis live below the poverty line, with significant disparities in poverty levels across different ethnic and caste groups, as well as between various regions of the country. The unemployment rate stands at 42 percent, creating a pervasive sense of vulnerability and hopelessness, particularly in rural areas.

In Nepal, food prices are heavily influenced by the Indian market. This case study aims to offer a comprehensive analysis of how food prices impact health in Nepal and to propose practical solutions for improving food security and nutrition.


**Objective**

The objective of the project include :
1. Examine the affordability of a healthy diet. 

2. Analyze the prevalence of undernourishment and its correlation with food prices. 

3. Identify key factors influencing high food prices. 

4. Understand the health implications of unaffordable diets. 

5. Provide evidence-based recommendations to policymakers and stakeholders to address high food prices, enhance diet affordability, and improve public health outcomes. 


**Key Findings**

1.Nepalâ€™s daily cost of a healthy diet is significantly higher than in neighboring countries like India and China.

2.The percentage of undernourished individuals in Nepal increased steadily from 2017 to 2021.

3.Rising food prices were not primarily driven by inflation, but rather by a declining agricultural workforce.

4.The shift away from agriculture reduced food production, contributing to the increased cost of a healthy diet.


**Recommendation**

1. Public Awareness Campaigns: Use various platforms to educate the population on healthy eating, with guidance from healthcare professionals to improve food choices and public health.

2. Market Basket Analysis: Apply Market Basket Analysis to optimize supply chains, reduce waste, and create affordable, healthy food options, stabilizing prices for lower-income households.

3. Address Agricultural Employment and Increase Investment: Investigate the causes of declining agricultural employment and increase funding in the sector to boost productivity, reduce food prices, and support long-term development.
